  description: 
  rustDescription: "The Scrap Transport Helicopter is an improved version of the Minicopter.
  It offers 2 seats and an empty rear for large clans to stand on.
  It has bulletproof plates covering both sides to hide and has more
  health compared to the Minicopter. Driving the Scrap Heli is much
  harder compared to the Minicopter which flies like a feather.\r\nIf
  the Scrap Heli crashed on land, the body parts can be mined similar
  to the Patrol Helicopter."
