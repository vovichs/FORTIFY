  description: 
  rustDescription: "The Motor Rowboat is a surprisingly cheap transport vehicle that
  can be bought at fishing villages or found near shores, however can
  only be used to navigate the ocean. It requires low grade fuel to
  run and can fit 3 passengers and 1 driver. It also has a small stash
  in the front for extra storage.\r\nIt is commonly used for searching
  sunken chests with diving equipments, looting junkpiles on water
  and serves as an option to access Oil Rigs. The rowboat is exposed
  to ranged weapons and you can be shot from anywhere. However, switching
  seats while the engine is still on will not force the boat to stop.
  So, you can heal and shoot enemies targeting you. You can also dismount
  from the boat and shoot Oil Rig scientists from far away."
