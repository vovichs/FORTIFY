  description: 
  rustDescription: "The Reinforced Glass Window is now the highest-tier glass window.
  It replaced the Strengthened glass Window's spot for the highest
  HP window, and you are now unable to shoot through it. This makes
  it vital for loot rooms and external TCs. Not very useful for information
  gathering, as the viewing area is quite small and obstructed by thick
  bars."
