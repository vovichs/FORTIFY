  description: 
  rustDescription: "The RHIB, also known as Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat, is an alternative
  transport to travel on water. Same as the Motor Rowboat, it requires
  low grade fuel to run but consumes more than the motor rowboat. The
  benefits of RHIB is better than Motor Rowboat, having a larger storage
  box, more passenger seats and a bulletproof glass for the driver
  seat.\r\nThe RHIB does not spawn near coasts and instead can be bought
  at fishing villages or found as an escape vehicle for the Cargo Ship."
